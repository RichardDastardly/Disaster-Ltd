B9 HL fuselage parts scaled up 125% - this allows 2.5m parts with external attachments, and fixed 3.75m parts to be carried.


Parts included

* Both cargo bays
* Both tails
* Short structural fuselage ( including tank setup )
* Two new adapter pieces to join to existing HL / stock mk3 parts - with multiple tanks

Many things to be worked out - pinching/stretching issues and some material issues, and maybe just ditch it all for a 130% version that will launch 3.75m parts.

HL crew tank/lifesupport module in the works. Future plans for a more spaceplane style cockpit.
